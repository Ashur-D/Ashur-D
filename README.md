If your seeing this I just graduated highschool and Im working towards a network engineering degree in the next couple of years. I'm someone who likes learning about how operating systems work especially Windows and more recently Linux. I've mostly been a Windows user but Linux has been fun and is starting to feel better than windows. I enjoy exploring customization tools, improving my workflow, and tweaking the look and speed of my system. Ill be trying to make more project here on github as I learn, I wish to get better at github as its been one of my favourite platofrms recently and I love trying out other peoples projects. I also made a windows guide that features a ton of programs I use on my windows system that I would recommend checking out.
