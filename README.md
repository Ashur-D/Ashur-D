# 🦇 Ashur Dawod


If your seeing this I just graduated highschool and Im working towards a network engineering degree in the next couple of years. I'm someone who likes learning about how operating systems work especially Windows and more recently Linux. I've mostly been a Windows user but Linux has been fun and is starting to feel better than windows. I enjoy exploring diffrent types of tools, improving my workflow, and tweaking the look and speed of my system, as well as my system being clean,sleek and minmal. Ill be trying to make more project here on github as I learn, I wish to get better at github as its been one of my favourite platofrms recently and I love trying out other peoples projects. I also made a windows guide that features a ton of programs I use on my windows system that I would recommend checking out.
